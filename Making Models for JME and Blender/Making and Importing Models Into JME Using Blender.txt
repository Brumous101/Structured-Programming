Making a Model and Importing in JME


-----In JME-----
1. Either create a new project or open an existing one.
2. Add a folder under assets/models called "ogre"

-----In Blender-----
1. Hit numpad 5 and toggle into orthographic view
2. Tab into Mesh mode
3. Ctrl + Tab and select Faces
4. Still in edit mode, hit the a key to select the entire mesh if not already highlighted. Hit u to unwrap
the model (select "uSmart UV Project")
5.A. In the UV window create a new UV image (image > new)
5.B. Make and NAME new image before you save
6.A. Save the image (image > save as image) 
6.B. Make sure to save in the ogre folder
7. Give your object a material. Play with the color and shaders
8. Under textures, set Type to "Image or Movie"
9. Under textures, under image, select the image you saved in step 6.
10. Under textures, under MAPPING not Image MAPPING, set the Coordinates to "UV"
11. Back in the 3D window you can see how your model looks with the texture
by selecting the Textured Draw Type
12. Select the Texture Paint Mode. Hit the t key to open the color picker if it does not automatically appear and then begin painting.
13.A. The painting you do to the model in the 3d window gets mapped onto the UV image in the UV window. 
13.B. Once you have finished painting you will need to resave your UV image file (image > save image)
14.A. Export your project (file > export > Ogre3D(.scene and .mesh) ) 
14.B. Make sure to save in the ogre folder

-----In JME-----
1. Right click on boxMesh.mesh.xml and click Convert to JME binary. This will compile a file called boxMesh.mesh.j3o. This is the file we will load. (If the jme3 complains that the material file is not named correctly you can either rename it to what jme3  wants, or re-export from Blender making sure that you correctly name the material in the export screen)
2. Use the following code inside the simpleInitApp override to place your model into the JME:
	Spatial myModel = assetManager.loadModel("Models/ogre/myModelName.mesh.j3o");
	rootNode.attachChild(myModel);
